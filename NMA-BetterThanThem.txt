Arrangement & Lyrics
-----------------------

[Verse]
This is our town, this is Friday night
dressed in our rags and our rage and our best
piercing eyes looking for something,
anything, just anyone..

stare across the floors as they begin to dance
missing all the rythms and the chosen right steps
and we laugh and we drink in our corner again
we're better than them... (we're better than them)
we're better than them... (we're better than them)

Divided we were born,divided we live
divided we fall,yeah,divided we die
still we tell ourselves over and over again
we're better than them... (we're better than them)
we're better than them...

[Special]
With our hunger and our hatred
we all walk this town
with our fear and our weakness
just holding on
with our doubt and our emptyness
and this cold,cold frown
we got to be so important
we'll put the whole damn world down.

[Verse]
And we build the walls that we can hide behind
and our finest weapon is our poisoned pride
here in this town where the jealousies burn
we're watching you... (we're watching you)
and truth is only what we need it to be
to bring us survival through each and every day
where nowhere is safe and nowhere is home
just be cool... (be cool)

And what was she wearing and what did he say
who goes with who and what did they do?
yeah, we tell ourselves over and over again
we're better than them (we're better than them)
we're better than them (we're better than them)

[Special]
With our hunger and our hatred
we all walk this town
with our fear and our weakness
just holding on
with our doubt and our emptyness
and this cold,cold frown
we got to be so important
we'll put the whole damn world down.

[Verse]
Divided we were born,divided we live
divided we fall,yeah,divided we die
still we tell ourselves over and over again
we're better than them... (we're better than them)
we're better than them... (we're better than them)

We're better than them... (We're not like them)
                  [C]                             [Em]
We're better than them... (we're better than them)
                  [Am]          [G]
We're better than them... (oooh them)
                  [C]           [C]
We're better than them...
