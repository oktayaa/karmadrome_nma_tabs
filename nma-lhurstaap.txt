Intro: [A5] 

[Am]
One swallow never made a spring
[Am]                                           [G]
You can buy a crown - it doesn't make you king
           [F]      [G]
Beware the trinkets that we bring

         [Am]                 [F]              [Dsus2]         [F]
When the visionary dreams set hard and grey as flesh made into stone
    [Am]             [F]                    [Dsus2]       [G]
You tore the statues to the ground crying - let my people go
                [F] [G]      [Am]  [F]
And now they're gone, all is gone 
          [F]                       [G]
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile

[Am]
The freedom passion and the two faced call
[Am]                           [G]
They dance together upon the wall
             [F]     [G]         
With nothing left to break the fall

[Am]

Now twenty-five miles north in the great dark woods
The college buildings stand
And the ghosts of hope walk silent halls at the death of the Promised Land
All is gone, all is gone 
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile 

[Am]

One swallow never made a spring
You can buy a crown - it doesn't make you king

           [Bm]                             [C#m]          [G]
And in the shadows of the crowded square, a thousand paper deals go down
    [Bm]                          [C#m]               [G]
And hungry sharks from everywhere smell the blood and head for town
[Bm]                                [C#m]         [G]
Innocence starts to peel away - How money changes everything
    [Bm]                                [C#m]             [G]    [Am] 
The past it eats the future up and this blind desire eats everything 

[Am]

Now the rats they leave one stricken ship for another sailing past
Your world was going nowhere slow while ours goes nowhere fast
And now it's gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can blow cold and hostile

The freedom passion and the two faced call
