Intro: G#m

     B
In a nowhere bar-room on the east side of the city
                                     G#m
There was a strange smell of burning outside in the street
      B
I was giving a sermon like the son of a preacher
                             G#m
I was high on revolution and wild with belief
 B
Across the table she was lighting a cigarette
                                  F#                       G#m
And in the light of the flame her eyes flashed fury as she turned to me


                  E                    G#m
She said - you're never gonna save the world
       E                    G#m
you're never gonna save the world
       E                    F#
you're never gonna save the world
                  G#m
If you can't save me

G#m

   B
On Calvary Hill, the sky turned black
                                  G#m
And the wind blew the dust in the blistering heat
        B
But the heavens were empty, no angels came
                                  F#                     G#m
The only sound i remember was the crying of Mary and the mother's weep


                
And he cried out - you're never gonna save the world
you're never gonna save the world
you're never gonna save the world
If you can't save me


It's all vanity and you're never gonna save the world
you're never gonna save the world
you're never gonna save the world
If you can't save me
