Intro: Am

                Am                   C/G
The lovers they kiss and slowly they turn
              Am                            F
for drawing a breath there is nothing but time
                   Am                           C/G
A thousand million years before we crash in the sun
F                            Am
Still we will be here in Her arms 
                   Am                        C/G
In the thick black night we could lie in the grass
                Am                           F
And gaze at the sky and watch the satellites pass
                   Am                        C/G
A thousand million miles, the earth She will turn
     F                            Am
Then still we will be here in Her arms 
C/G                         C?  Am
And if we can float away in our dreams
          C/G                   C?  Am
There's a city that waits under the sea 
    Em
The days to pass living in the rose
    Em
The seeded land slow and old
    Em
The scented air heavy and warm
Em
Whispers, touches . . .

Am, C/G, Am, F
   
                   Am                           C/G
A thousand million years before we crash in the sun
F                            Am    F
Still we will be here in Her arms 
            Am
here in her arms
