Lyrics & Arrangement
---------------------

[Verse] 4x

[Verse] I get so angry and helpless 
	There's no way back from this spiral 
	Something always has to give 
	And nothing is given for nothing

	The drug is in my veins now 
	Your life is your own for the taking 
	My body must be slowing down now 
	But my heart is at the speed of flying

[Chorus]I'm walking out, I close the door 
	I'm down the steps for the last time 
[Verse] 2x
[Verse] You can lose too much to ever want to start 
	Over again - over again
[Verse] 2x
 
[Verse] When I look back and think about it 
	All I see is her face staring into mine 
	I feel the child holding onto me 
	I'm smelling his sweet smell of innocence

[Verse] 2x

[Verse] The world has become too silent 
	This night it seems everlasting 
	The clocks ticking on like dripping water 
	But the hands are not moving

[Chorus]I'm walking out, I close the door 
	I'm down the steps for the last time 
[Verse] 2x 
[Chorus]Then dawn breaks open in faded blue 
	And the sounds of the city waking
[Verse] 2x
 
[Verse] 2x
[E5] 

[Chorus]I'm walking out, I close the door 
	I'm down the steps for the last time 
[Verse] 2x 
[Chorus]But the grass is soaked with fallen dew 
	And the sun is almost rising
[Verse] 2x

[Chorus]
[Verse] 2x

End on [E5]
