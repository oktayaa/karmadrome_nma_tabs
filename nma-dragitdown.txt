[Intro] 4x

[Verse] They started work this morning down at city square
  ""    They're pulling down the statues of our great grandfather's hero
  ""    The new books said he wasn't such a great man after all
  ""    And anyway remember that the times they are a-changing 

[Chorus] Pull it down, drag it down
  ""     Till there's nothing to look up to
  ""     But the brand names on the posters all around

[Bm]

[Verse] They proved on television last night that God was just a lie
  ""    He never made the world at all 
  ""    It was just some sweet old fashioned rite
  ""    So melt down all the ornaments, move out all the graves
  ""    And let us build the disco that we need for our young braves 

[Chorus] Pull it down, drag it down
  ""     Till the hopes and dreams of all the ages 
  ""     Past are shattered on the ground 

[Bridge1] 2x

[Bridge1] We think we are so clever killing heroes, killing magic, 
  ""      Until everything that's sacred is brought down to our level 
  ""      for Mammon is a jealous master, - leaves no room for any other
  ""      All the questions left unanswered, all the answers gone forever
  ""      So bow to the woman in the finest fur
  ""      Bow to the man with the ace street cool
  ""      Bow to the woman with all the power
  ""      Bow to the man with all the money
  ""      In whose sight are we equal now? (4x)

[Bridge2] Now that we've killed God (3x)

[Verse] (2x)

[Chorus] Pull it down, drag it down
  ""     Till there's nothing to look up to
  ""     Past are shattered on the ground
  ""     Pull it down, drag it down
  ""     Till the hopes and dreams of all the ages 
  ""     Past are shattered on the ground 

End on [Bm]
