The office lines are busy and the girls are working hard
  [C/G]                                    [G]
Tonight they'll be out clubbing with their boyfriends busy wishing they were
[D5]                                      [D7]
Gentlemen please take your seats, there's champagne in the boardroom

Let's drink a toast to prosperity, tell the waiting pressmen that


[Chorus1]
[Gm]                [F]                   [Bb]                   [F]
No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all 
No, no, no, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all


[Verse]
Remember locking all the doors before you went to bed
Then waking with those racing dreams ringing round your head
The future's full of shining cars on shining tarmac roads
Cutting through the wasted years and all the old abandoned tracks and

[Chorus]
No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
No, no, no, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
             [Bb]          [C]          [Bb]              [C]
So keep that smile on your face, have a drink to help you sleep at night
     [Bb]             [C]          [Bb]             [C]       [D5]
They got what they desired - We're passive in their brave new world 


[D5] a couple of times
[D5][D5/Bb][D5/F][G5] 2x


   [D5]                            [D5/Bb]
We are not young and beautiful, we are not rich and bold
    [D5/F]                     [G5]
And we are not your people who bought the dreams you sold
       [D5]                           [D5/Bb]
And we hate your smiling faces and we hate what you have done
   [D5/F]                       [G5]
We hate your patronising and we hate your cold blue eyes
    [D#]                        [Dm]
And we all feel this raging and we all feel the same
     [D#]                     [Dm]
This crazy blinding fury that we cannot explain
    [Bb]                   [C]
And we all see reflections in our lover's eyes
   [Bb]                          [C]
We live with so few troubles but with so many, many lies and


[Chorus]
No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
No, no, no, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
             [Bb]          [C]          [Bb]              [C]
So keep that smile on your face, have a drink to help you sleep at night
     [Bb]             [C]          [Bb]             [C]       [Gm]
They got what they desired - We're passive in their brave new world

There's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
No, no, no, there's nothing wrong here, nothing's wrong here, nothing at all
So keep that smile on your face, have a drink to help you sleep at night
They got what they desired - We're passive in their brave new world
