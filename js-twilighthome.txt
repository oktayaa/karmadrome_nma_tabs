Intro: [A?] [G?] (2x)

Now the thick warm cream light
fades down into the mist from the sea
Three surfers - tiny black specks
out across in great waves
Lanterns of the little town over on the hill -
twilight sweet homecoming
It's all the same


[C/G]
And these things we hold in our hearts
Like a promise in the salt of our blood
              [A?]   [G?]
Until we come home

And always the breathing of the breaking surf
Drifts through the curtains and 
through our dreaming

[C/G]
And these things we hold to ourselves
Like a promise in the salt of our blood
              [A?]
Until we come home
              [C/G]   
Until we come home
              [Em]
Until we come home

[A?] [C/G] [A?] [G?]

Until we come home
