[Intro] 2x
[A5] 4x

[Riff 1] Through the years of decay we walk like tigers in cages
[Riff 2] With each passing turn the smaller and smaller the circles
[Riff 1] Every weapon and word legitimate now as protection
[Riff 1] But these things should never be spoken
[Riff 2] These things should never be spoken 

[Intro] 1x
[A5] 4x

[Riff 1] I stand undefeated alone in the ring just pacing
[Riff 2] The sweat and the blood dried on my hands all wasted
[Riff 3] I'm shouting "come back and fight for I am the king"
         But the lights are all out and the people are gone
[Riff 4] We always burned brightest when no one was watching
         Now I kiss the lines on your beautiful face

[A5] 2x

[Riff 1] But these things should never be spoken
[Riff 2] These things should never be spoken 

[Intro] 2x
[A5] 4x

[Riff 1] And sometimes your hunger for life seems like desperation
[Riff 2] And when I read about the world these days all I can feel is hatred
[Riff 3] The fortune teller is closing her doors
         She looked into the crystal and saw nothing at all
[Riff 4] They're waiting round here for something to happen
         They won't really want it when it rolls out to greet them

[A5] 3x

[Riff 1] But these things should never be spoken
[Riff 2] These things should never be spoken
[Riff 1] But these things should never be spoken
[Riff 2] These things should never be spoken

[Intro] 2x
end on [A5]
