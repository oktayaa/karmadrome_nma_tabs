 Tabbed by Bjoern Ahrens (nma-tabs@gmx.de)
 
 note: I don't know if those are the real chords, but it sounds
 pretty good on an acoustic guitar..
 
 *March 2004: substituted the Esus2(022452) with an easier-to-play Emadd9(022002)

unusual chords:
---------------
Asus2 (x02200)
B5    (x2440x) 
Emadd9(022002)
G6    (320400)
---------------

Intro:
[Emadd9][G6] 2x

    [Emadd9]
The curtain breathes, the air swims
    [G6]
The sweat dries cold on the shivering skin
    [Emadd9]                          [G6]
The sheets they twist and turn again, round and round
   [Emadd9]
My mother she feeds and cares for me
[G6]
Shackled to responsibility
[Emadd9]                       [G6]
All her precious dreams for me crashing down
 
Chorus:
-------
[C/G]            [Bm]     [Am]               [Bm]               
Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK
[C/G]              [Bm]       [Am]       [Bm]
Tell them all just not today, not today, not today

[Emadd9][G6] 2x

They're building special facilities
Laboratory animals die for me
I live with my humility - humility
November 1989, they're dancing on the Berlin Wall tonight
I feel the flow of history and have no part 

Chorus:
Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK
Tell them all just not today, not today, not today

[Emadd9]

  [B5]            [Asus2]              [G]        [F#m]  
A little night in town we said - oh I remember very well
[B5]              [Asus2]         [G]             [F#m]  
They'll be out of prison soon and me I'm stuck forever in this . . . 

[Emadd9][G6] 4x

I went for my mother to a holy shrine
The wheelchairs rattled through the afternoon
Over the cobbles and up the hill
In an ordered procession of desperate will
It hurts just the way it hurts today
Those moments come, then recede away
Better to accept what you cannot change
The less the pain . . . 

Chorus:
Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK
Tell them all just not today, not today, not today

[C/G][Asus2][Em][Asus2]
[C/G][Asus2][Em][Em]
[Emadd9]    [G6]  several times...
