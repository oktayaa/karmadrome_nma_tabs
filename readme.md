# This is a mirror of Bjoern Ahrens's New Model Army tabs page from 2017.

You can access the contents in the original web site format at : http://blog.xpufx.com/karmadrome_nma_tabs/
Everything is the same as downloaded from the website rar dump aside from the warning at the top.

Karmadrome's tabs are some of the most accurate and detailed for New Model Army songs. Unfortunately the site disappeared somewhere around 2017. I have tried to contact the site owner Bjoern Ahrens at that time but did not receive a response.
He was nice enough to provide a link to download the whole site archive as a rar file. That's what I used to recreate and host this site. Hope it will gain some visiblity again.

The site can still be accessed via archive.org at https://web.archive.org/web/20161223134336/http://home.arcor.de/karmadrome/
