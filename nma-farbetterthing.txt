Intro: [A5]

[C/G]   [G]                 [Am] [E] 
 In the white washed cancer ward 
[C/G]    [G]               [Am]
 with my hot blood running wild
[E]        [Bm]             [E]          [G]
 I see the pain behind your eyes and the search for a reason
[E]      [Bm]            [E]         [G]
 And the knowing and the fear of the passing season
[Csus2]                        [C#sus2]
Now please give me strength to cut and to keep our secret
[Csus2]                           [C#sus2]
        Please give me strange to cut


Chorus:
-------
                   [Am]               [Dsus2]
That the things we love may remain here still
                 [Am]                       [G]
There is time to wait and there's a time to kill
                        [Dsus2]                  [Am]
I see your outstretched hand through the closing door
           [C/G]      [G]     [Am]           [G]    [Dsus2]
But it's a far better thing I do than I have done before

[Dsus2]


    [C/G]            [G]             [Am] [E] 
And so it seems that murder's not so hard 
[C/G]       [G]                  [Am]
 I've eaten flesh and blood each day
[E]         [Bm]               [E]               [G]              
 And if I believe the things I write through the passing season
[E]          [Bm]        [E]             [G]
 Then with a rifle in my hand and with a thousand reasons
     [Csus2]             [C#sus2] 
I'll wait, far above the crowd in the summer sunshine
[Csus2]                    [C#sus2]
       And history changes now, forever 

Chorus:
-------
That the things we love may remain here still
There is time to wait and there's a time to kill
From the barren land come the seeds of war
So it's a far better thing that I do than I have done before
It's a far better thing that I do than I have done before

[Dsus2]

That the things we love may remain here still
There is time to wait and there's a time to kill
I see your outstretched hand through the closing door
But it's a far better thing I do than I have done before
It's a far better thing I do than I have done before
It's a far better thing I do than I have done before
