[Intro Riff] a couple of times


[Verse Riff]
Days into weeks of Sunday afternoons
Nothing much for us to say nothing real for us to do
Just watch the carousel go round and round in endless circles
in the pupil of the Deadeye until you just feel numb
It's virtual Jerusalem. There's not much trouble anymore
it's mostly the blissed-out stuff that people really go for
        [Dsus2]                 [A/C#]
and the juggernaut tyranny of oblivion 4/4
[Verse Riff]

Double, triple bluff and then back on itself
a world of ironies and tribute bands, everything downsized
I don't know where it was but I swear I've heard that song
it was a century of answers and all of them were wrong.

[Chorus]
[G][Dsus2/F#]           [Em]  
   Wake me in a thousand years
[Dsus2]               [A/C#]
Wake me in a thousand years
[C/G]                 [G]     [A5]
Wake me in a thousand years

[Verse Riff][Dsus2][A/C#] 2x

[Verse Riff]
Sorry little island, you look better in the rain
You looked more honest in blue or something we can't see through
and out across the world I see four billion claims 
and all of them have faces and all of them have names
Enough. 

[Chorus]
[G][Dsus2/F#]           [Em]  
   Wake me in a thousand years
[Dsus2]               [A/C#]
Wake me in a thousand years
[C/G]                 [G]     [A5]
Wake me in a thousand years
[F][G][F]                    [Em]
       Wake me in a thousand years
[Dsus2]               [A/C#]
Wake me in a thousand years

[Verse Riff]
The Prozac dawn opens milky white
                         [Dsus2]                [A/C#]
I don't remember what it was I got so passionate about
                       [Verse Riff]
It's all now digitally synthesised, enhanced, seduced, stainless
                 [Dsus2]                [A/C#]
the bad smell of poverty disguised, deodorised
                          [Verse Riff]
There's just the scent of money and Privilege still intact 
                            [Dsus2]                [A/C#]
A century of madness put to sleep to start over again
                            [Em]
Here comes the Presidential train.


[Verse Riff]
We looked into the crystal and we felt the Fear
                 [Dsus2]                [A/C#]
but it's already here, it's already too late
                  [Verse Riff]
We're learning to love the things that we hate
                  [Dus2]                  [A/C#]
We're learning to love the things that we hate
                  [Verse Riff]
We're learning to love the things that we hate
                  [Dus2]                  [A/C#]
We're learning to love the things that we hate
