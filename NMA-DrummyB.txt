Intro:

[Am]    [G?]     [C]    [D?][C]

   [Am]
The bonfires blazed across the city
   [G?]
The smoke swirling into the sky
       [C]
We were standing shoulder to shoulder
[D?]            [C]
Billy McCann and I

Our faces ruddy and burning
As we stared into the flames
But I know now the things that we saw that night
Were not the same 

Ch:
     [C]
And I see you as I walk away
[Am]             [G?]
Standing by your barricade
        [C]
It's all over now between us
[D?]            [C]
Billy McCann goodbye 


[Am]    [G?]     [C]    [D?][C]


So we'll sit up at the bar for the last time
The way we used to do
And I'll toast the love that you showed me
And the faith I gave to you
And we can drive out and watch the sunrise
From the top of the Glenshane Pass
And I won't make you answer the questions
I've always tried to ask 

[C]

Ch: 
Now I see you as I walk away
Standing still by your barricade
It's all over now between us
Billy McCann goodbye
I see you as I walk away
Standing by your barricade
And though you never will forgive me
Billy McCann goodbye

[Am]    [G?]     [C]    [D?][C]
