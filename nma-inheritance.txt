=========================

[B5]

[B5]
Mother, Father, I'm doing OK
On the other side of the country, far away
And though I know the things that you want to hear me say
Sometimes these things are hard 
Mother, Father, I am your son
Right down to the long thin pointed face 
And this muddled up and twisted tongue
And now I find that I'm doing 
All those things you would have done
Sometimes these things are hard 

        [D5]
So do I thank you? Do I curse you?
These tracks stretch out before me - the ones you left behind
       [B5]
What I want and what I feel - it's yours, yours, not mine 

[D5] a couple of times
[B5] a couple of times

[B5]
Mother, Father, all those battles that have been
And the long, long silences that lay in between
Please don't try to tell me all those were in vain
Sometimes these things are hard
We line up at the wedding in rows of deep set eyes
In our finest formal dresses and proper suits and ties
Like a family of Munsters in a really bad disguise

        [D5]
So do I thank you? Do I curse you?
