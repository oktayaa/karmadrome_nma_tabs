Intro:

[Bsus][Asus2] 8x

[D] [G]    [Bm]
Time passes slow
[Em]                    [F#m]
Fields stretch out across open acres
[D] [G]    [Bm]
Time passes slow
   [Em]                   [F#m]     
The giant steps of mankind touch us so little in the
[Bsus]     [Asus2]
great lands 

Our little storm
Whirls away out across calm wide oceans
In this sacred breath
You and I falling for ever and ever and ever 


   [Em]          [Dsus2]     [CMaj7/G)         [Dsus2]    [Em]          
The news peoples' dull voices bring the distant tidings of great disasters, 
[Dsus2]    [CMaj7/G]        [Dsus2]           [Em]        [Dsus2] 
politicians speaking in some solemn tones, the crisis of a different world, the 
[CMaj7/G]   [Dsus2]        [Em]       [Dsus2]   [CMaj7/G]
panic of the thousands, the destiny of millions,          so far away 


[Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2]


Time passes slow
Sunlight sparkles on rippling waters
And the trees they sway
I don't believe in the things that I can't see 
Our little storm
Whirls away out across calm wide oceans
In this sacred breath
You and I falling for ever and ever and ever

[Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2] [Bsus][Asus2]
