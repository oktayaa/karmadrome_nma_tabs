Intro:
[Am][E][G][E] 2x

[Am]      [G]          [Em]
We are not children any more
[Am]         [G]         
The fists you made they are come
[Em]
Bashing at your door
    [F]                      [Am]
Your legacy is waiting in the wings
           [F]
And there's something so familiar
       [Am]           [E]
In this hunger that we bring

  [Bm]          [G]
We don't want to be like you
[E]          [Dsus2]
Don't want to live like you
[Bm]               [G]
Learn by our own mistakes, thank you
[E]             [Dsus2]
Forcing time and pushing through 

Chorus:
[Am]
You are not our heroes  
[E]
You are not our heroes  
[G]                      [E]
You are not our heroes anymore 

Verse 2: (same chords as verse 1)
Dim the lights the time is come
Into the ring the father and the son
Sown in sweat and passion long ago
And now the blood on our hands
Is the same as our own . .

And the man has the skill
And the man has the power
But the boy has the will to win
And so much time . . . 

Ch 
You are not our heroes.. anymore

[Em]        [B]
If you knew then
         [D]            [B]
What you know now to be true
   [Em]             [B]
You never would have started
          [D]               [B]
This whole chain we're going through

And you love us now
But you hate us still
And we hate you now
But we love you still . . .

[Em][Em][B][B][D][D][B][B]

[Bm][G][E][D] 4x

Ch:
You are not our heroes anymore
You are not my mother
You are not my father . . .
