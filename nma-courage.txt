Intro: [Dm][F][Gm][F]-[A]


[Verse]:
   [Dm]                  
We walk every morning in silence
         [F]
Past the mills on Whetley Lane
          [Gm]
Where the lights went out for the very last time
         [F]            [A]       
And they never came on again
    [Dm]
The spokesman all shred crocodiles tears
       [F]
In the glory of the News at Ten
        [Gm]
But the proudest eyes are long since dry
            [F]                 [A]
And they're never going to cry again

[Chorus]:
    [Dm]                    [Am/C]
I salute your courage and I toast to your health
      [Bb]
And I wish you all the luck in the whole wide world
        [G*]                      [A]
May you never be broken like they say you will

[Verse]
Waking up sudden from a nightmare - you were walking the line in pain
With a shaven head to the slaughterhouse and you never came back again
But she took me in her arms and she held me
Close tight for a minute or two
And we laughed and smiled and closed our eyes
Slept again thinking of you 

[Chorus]
And the way that it is, the way that it really is
With the money talking and a scapegoat lover
With the painted face of a scolding mother 
And I salute your courage and I toast to your health
And I wish you all the luck in the whole wide world
May you never be broken like they say you will be

[F#m][F#m][E][C#m] (2x)

    [G#m]             [A]          [E]
Now lost in time, cut off from history
     [G#m]                     [A]   [B]
This is not knowledge, this is information

[Dm][F][Gm][F]-[A] (2x)

[Chorus]
And I salute your courage and I toast to your health
And I wish you all the luck in the whole wide world
May you never be broken like they say you will be

And the way that it is, the way that it really is
With the money talking and a scapegoat lover
With the painted face of a scolding mother 

[Verse]
We walk every morning in silence
Past the mills on Whetley Lane
Where the lights went out for the very last time
And they never came on again
         [Dm]
And they never came on again
         [F]
And they never came on again

[Gm]
