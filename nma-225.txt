Intro:
[Am][Am][Am][G]
 
[D]

[D]
She stares at the screen, at the little words of green
            [Am]     [G]     [D]
Tries to do remember what to do next
          [D]
There's a trace of frustration that crosses her face
[Am]              [G]            [D]
Searching for the key she should press
    [F]                   [D] 
And I would help her if I only know how
          [C/G]                      [F] 
But these things are a mystery to me too
       [D]            [G]       [Am]          [G] 
And it seems that the Corporate eyes they are watching
    [D]           [G]         [Am]        [G] 
She fears for her job and the moments are passing
  [D]          [G]           [Am]     [G] 
I stare at her nametag and I think to myself
             [D]         [C/G]     [D]  
Both you and I, we never asked for any of this


So let's take a walk up past the chemical works 
Where the sky turns green at night 
And we'll talk about getting away from here
Some different kind of life 
But even in the freshest mountain air 
The jet fighters practise overhead 
And they're drilling these hills for uranium deposits 
And they'll bury the waste for our children to inherit 
And though this is all done for our own benefit, 
I swear we never asked for any of this 


This golden age of communication 
Means everyone talks at the same time 
And liberty just means the freedom to exploit 
Any weakness that you can find 
Turn off the TV just for a while 
Let us whisper to each other instead 
And we'll hope that the Corporate ears do not listen 
Lest we find ourselves committing some kind of treason 
And filed in the tapes without rhyme, without reason 
While they tell us that it's all for our own protection, 
I swear we never asked for any of this 
I swear we never asked for any of this 
I swear we never asked for any of this
I swear
