[G]        [Asus2]           [Bm]           [Asus2]
Across the flatlands we came out of nowhere special
       [G]         [Asus2]            [Bm]           [F#m]
Like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapons in our hands
   [G]                  [Asus2]         [Bm]               [Asus2]
We crashed the gates so hard we'd never heard that kind of sound before
    [G]                  [Asus2]         [Bm]          [F#m]
And braced ourselves for victory and the spoils of the land
[Em]                          [F#m]
Defences melt away before our frozen blank surprise
         [Em]                       [F#]
From the palace now we stare into a million waiting eyes


Chorus:
-------
            [Bm]            [Asus2]              [F#m]
I've got my trophies on the wall, the heads I've hunted down the hall
      [Bm]              [Asus2]          [F#m]
And I guard my winnings well, carry them with me when I fall
        [Bm]           [Asus2]       [F#m]
Now the daylight hours pass like the people I have lost
       [Bm]           [Asus2]      [F#m]
In the triumph of the hour, in the bloody cause - lust for power 


[G][Asus2][Bm][Asus2] 2x


Like a vision she dances through the shafts of light
Everything I've ever dreamed about focused true and bright
And fortune opens up the ground, blackens out the sky
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice but I couldn't remember why
When I was young they taught me well to always play to win
But they never said what happens when you've won the bloody game 

Chorus: I've got my trophies on the wall. . . 


Bridge:
-------
[Em][Dsus2/F#][C/G] 2x

    [Am]                        [B]
And all desire is satisfied but still the hunt goes on
     [Em]                              [F#]
It's funny how this feeling stays with all the reasons gone 

[F#]

We've seen them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame
I've run for home and words gone by but nothing seems the same
I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass
From the other my reflection and I don't know which is worse
The streets are lined with glittering stores and a million fatted calves
I can catch myself sometimes these days and all I do is laugh, laugh

Chorus: I've got my trophies on the wall . . .

[G][Asus2][Bm][Asus2]
[G][Asus2][Bm][G]-[F#]
