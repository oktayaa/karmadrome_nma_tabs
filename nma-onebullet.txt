[Verse] 
             [D]                 [C?]
In a ring of men, with money changing hands
              [D]                            [C?]
All the gypsy kings, they were gathered from miles around
                    [D]                [C?]
I was tapped on the shoulder, stripped to the waist
          [D]                       [C?]   
But I was quick, I was quicker than all of them

[Bridge]
              [Em]                    [D]
I watched him fall, then he staggered back
                      [C/G]                  [D]
There was blood on my hands, but my face was intact
                   [Em]                [D]
I picked up all my money and I walked away
                  [C/G]                 [D]
It was like I was chosen, but I did not choose 

[Verse]
I was in love, it was just the one time
It was years ago, I still have her photograph
I look at it sometimes, when I’m on my own
I think of her sometimes, when I’m on my own

[Bridge]
We fought the once and she went down
I’m sorry now, but you can’t go back
I was wrong and I have paid
Carry it with me for the rest of my days. 

[Chorus]
So tell me
[Am]                [D]                 [G]                    [Am]
    Do you keep one bullet left for yourself for when it’s all over and done?
    Do you keep one bullet left for yourself for when it’s all over and done?
    Do you keep one bullet left for yourself for when it’s all over and done? 
[Am]                [D]                 [Em]       
    Do you keep one bullet left for yourself 
        [D]
for yourself 

[Verse]
My grandmother’s house, it’s all empty now
I live here alone, nobody bothers me
I work on shift down at the bakery
And I fix up the house and I try to be happy

[Bridge]
My father’s rage is still in me
I bury it down where nobody sees
Everyone knows me here, but they don’t speak
Maybe that’s just the way that I like it to be 

[Chorus]
So tell me
Do you keep one bullet left for yourself
For when it’s all over and done? 

[Verse]
I’ve gone to ground just like the animals
Gone to ground just like the animals
In the fading light where all men go
Gone to ground just like the animals
