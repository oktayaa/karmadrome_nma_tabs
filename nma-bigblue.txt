[Riff 1] 4x

[Riff 1] So now let us sing of what remains
[Riff 1] There will be stillness in our hearts
[Riff 1] There will be a sweetness in our lives,
[Riff 1] bye and bye.
[Riff 1] There's a beach I know at the edge of the world, 
[Riff 1] mist rising up from the breaking waves 
[Riff 1] towards the cliffs, as green as god.
[Riff 1]

[Riff 2] We'll be flying for the sake of flying, singing for the sake of singing,
[Riff 3] looking back down on the lonely world - dive, dive, diving down 

[Riff 1] Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves,
[Riff 1] gone are the doubts and the fear of falling
[Riff 1] hate is a curse lifted from our shoulders,
[Riff 1] we never meant it in the way they thought. 

[Riff 1] If we hold our nerve, they will travel right over us;
[Riff 1]
[Riff 1] they'll be going so fast they will never even notice us.
[Riff 1]

[Riff 2] We'll be flying for the sake of flying - singing for the sake of singing,
[Riff 3] looking back down on the lonely world - dive, dive, dive

[Riff 1] Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves
[Riff 1] gone are the doubts and the fear of falling 
[Riff 1] hate is a curse lifted from our shoulders,
[Riff 1] we never meant it in the way they thought.

[Riff 4] Time to die, and die, and die again; doors closing in empty houses;
[Riff 4] time to roll, and roll, and roll again - and all I hear is the diesel roaring.

[Riff 1] 4x

[Riff 2] Just like a people put to flight, all blown out in the endless dust storms,
[Riff 3] into the West and the rolling hills, to dive, dive, dive again and

[Riff 1] Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves
[Riff 1] gone are the doubts and the fear of falling 
[Riff 1] hate is a curse lifted from our shoulders,
[Riff 1] we never meant it in the way they thought.

[Riff 1]
[Riff 1] Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves
[Riff 1] gone are the doubts and the fear of falling 


[Riff 1] Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves
[Riff 1] gone are the doubts and the fear of falling 

[Riff 1] a couple of times, end on [Em].
