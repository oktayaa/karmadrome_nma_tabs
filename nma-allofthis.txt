
 New Model Army - All of This
 ----------------------------

 Tabbed by Bjoern Ahrens (nma-tabs@gmx.de)

 Since there is hardly any guitar in both the album and the acoustic version,
 I've added some basic chords to strum for the verse. Play them softly, or
 leave them out, as you wish.

          [A5]                                            [E5]
There's a sentry in a uniform to watch the VIPs along the hall
    [A5]                                                     [E5]
Strategical discussions taking place behind the steel plated wall
    [B5]                                                               [G?]
The agents issue the statements to the waiting press who circulate the words
[A5]                                                         [E5]
Justification, propaganda, Western foreign policy across the world

[Chorus]: 
       [Dm]           [Bb] [C]
In the name of the people
[Dm]       [Bb]        [C]
    In the name of the people
All of this is done 
in the name of the people 
All of this is done
in the name of the people
in the name of the people 

     [A5]                                                                  [E5]
They read their books and study hard, cigarettes lit in the claustrophobic gloom
[A5]                                                                [E5]
West of the University Road, the world outside is ghost-like in the room
    [B5]                                                           [G?]
Frustrated and impatient and intelligence sharp and twisted like a child
[A5]                                                       [E5]
Death is an aphrodisiac now, the fuses on the table slowly wired

[Chorus]:
In the name of the people
All of this is done in the name of the people

[Am]        [G#]      [Cm]   [G#]
Hold me tight, hold me fast
[Am]                  [G#]
Standing here on the wrong side
        [Cm]                [G#]
Of this bullet-proof glass
      [Am*]            [B]            [E5]
There are no questions left for us to ask 

[E5]

[A5]                                                                      [E5]
It's soldiers night at the discotheque, pick up a girl and drink to home afar
[A5]                                                             [E5]
Spending money like water on the watered drinks available at the bar
    [B5]                                                            [G?]
The ones who never were given much, never asked much of anything in recall
              [A5]                                                            [E5]
But there's a black bag in the corner and it doesn't belong to anyone here at all 

[Chorus]:
In the name of the people
All of this is done in the name of the people
