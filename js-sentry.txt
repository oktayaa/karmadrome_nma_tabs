Intro: [E5]

[E5]                                         [C/G]
Waiting in the setting sun at the end of the road
                [G]                        [C/G]
The armies have moved away like the fading gold
                      [E5]                    [C/G]
I stand sentry by the rusting gate but no one comes
        [G]                             [C/G]
Nothing moves this way in the valley of stone
    [A5]                             [C/G]
The evening shadows steal across the hills
             [G]           [C/G]      [G]     [C/G]
And only the seasons change, only the seasons change
         [E5]              [C/G]  [G]  [C/G]
only the seasons change


              [E5]                          [C/G]
And I've seen so much more than I wanted to see
              [G]                              [C/G]
The flies all swarming round in the blistering heat
           [E5]                       [C/G]
Layer upon layer here of the same old curse
              [G]                              [C/G]
The red blood draining down into the blood red earth
       [A5]                              [C/G]
In the end we  tell the stories just the same
             [G]             [C/G]       [G]             [C/G]   
And only the names have changed, only the names have changed
         [E5]                 [E5]
only the names have changed


    [A5]            [C/G]            [E5]
The empires rising, falling like the seas
      [A5]                [C/G]           [F#5]  [C/G]
Their voices are just the whispers in the trees

[E5] [C/G] [G] [C/G]

                  [E5]                            [C/G]
I lock the chain upon the gate for the end of the day
                          [G]                    [C/G]
I clean the gun that I'll never use and lay it away
       [A5]                               [C/G]
As the stars spread like splinters of the sun
             [G]         [C/G]        [G]       [C/G]
And only the seasons change, only the seasons change
         [E5]                [C/G]
only the seasons change
         [G]                 [C/G]
only the seasons change

[E5] (long)

only the seasons change....
