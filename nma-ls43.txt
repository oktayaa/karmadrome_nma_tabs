Lyrics & Arrangement
---------------------

[Riff 1] 1x

[Riff 1] Busted out to the halfway house at the top of Undercliffe Road
 	 You and me and your motorbike in the ice and the drifting snow
 	 3am and empty, the city ours alone
[Riff 2] And laughing through the trails of frozen breathing

[Riff 1] 2x

[Riff 1] I swore to you that I could fly if you'd only let me go
	 Holding on as we leant over the edge of Baildon Moor
	 And far beneath the shadowed lands, the rocks and the shapeless dark
[Riff 2] And all that space for us to fall in
	 And all I could feel was myself falling...

[Riff 1] 1x

[Riff 3] Neon weekends and madhouse nights and so much time to taste
	 We built monuments to the things we loved, then laid each one to waste
	 All in suicidal vengeance, screaming justice, justice now
[Riff 2] As across the burning bridges we thundered

[Riff 1] 3x 

[Riff 1] Now all the rooms at the Inn are taken by those wiser than us
	 We're still driving for the sunset, love, and then on into the dusk
	 Because all the dreams were meaningless and impossible to touch
[Riff 2] But we're still crazed enough to drive forever
[Riff 4] I swear that I can stay awake for ever

[Riff 1] 4x

End on [Em]
