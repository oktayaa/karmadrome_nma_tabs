The Festival is over and the strings of coloured lights
            [Riff 1]
are blowing crazy in the coming wind

               [Riff 1]
One bulb comes loose, smashes on the ground
                                        [Riff 1]
The empty streets pick up the sound, it echoes like a tiny gunshot
[Riff 1]
ringing through the damp and through the silence
[Riff 2]                                                  [Riff 2] 
Water trickles slowly like the feel of troubles only half washed away
[Riff 1]                                                        [Riff 1]
Behind the wire the watchman doing nights sits beside a wall of screens

but he's not watching
[Riff 1]
gazing into the steam rising from his cup of coffee
     [Riff 1]
He's locked away inside
[Riff 3]                    [Riff 1]
Staring into the light of a different world.

[Riff 1]
Near the top of Sandford Road, there's a parked Mondeo in the shadows
    [Riff 1]                                           [Riff 1]  
The lighting of a cigarette illuminates four faces not talking, just waiting
    [Riff 1]       
The man in the front passenger seat holds the phone to his ear
             [Riff 1]
listens to a thin voice giving the details
             [Riff 2]
While in the back the boy with the long hair
                                            [Riff 3]
stares out through the misty glass into the dark streets
                        [Riff 1] 
and into the light of a different world 

[Riff 1]

[Riff 1]                                        [Riff 1] 
Two streets down the restaurant is empty, 3am weeknights, dead-time
          [Riff 1]
The owner came here years ago and never lost the dream of going home
    [Riff 1]
but knows he never will
       [Riff 2]
In the kitchen his son sits head in hands thinks about leaving
                [Riff 2]
Anywhere - just somewhere that's not here
                   [Riff 3]
Doesn't look up or see the Mondeo passing outside
                                [Riff 1]
As he gazes into the light of a different world 

[Riff 1]

[Riff 3]                    [Riff 1]
staring into the light of a different world 

[Riff 1] 3x

[Riff 1]
There's a couple in a red car coming home late on the inner ring

not talking or listening to the music just lost in their own thoughts
[Riff 1]
The Mondeo shoots the lights at sixty-five
                     [Riff 1]
Swerves, catches the red car that spins and rolls
      [Riff 2]                              [Riff 2]
Lands upside down in a crumple of metal and shattered glass 
              [Riff 2] 
The girl sits trapped inside watching new blood trickle down her shoulder
[Riff 2]
Turns to see her boyfriend slumped against the dash 
            [Riff 2]
as a little crowd gathers round
[Riff 1]
'Make him wake up, make him wake up' she's screaming 
[Riff 1]
'Make him wake up, make him wake up' and now she's pushing at him
[Riff 1]
'Make him wake up, make him wake up'
         [Riff 3]                 [Riff 4]
But he's gone into the light of a different world

[Riff 4] 2x
