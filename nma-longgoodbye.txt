[Em][Cmaj7/G] 8x

[Em]              [Cmaj7/G]       [Em]             [Cmaj7/G]     
 Holed up in your little room, we talk for hour on empty hour,
[Em]           [Cmaj7/G]        [Em]               [Cmaj7/G]
 pacing up and down between the walls that we have built ourselves. 

Chorus:
-------
[Em]             [Cmaj7/G]   [Em]             [Cmaj7/G]           
No more with the long goodbye, I can't stand another tear;
[Em]                  [Cmaj7/G]   [Em]                   [Cmaj7/G]
 I won't wait for the bell to toll - straight on for the days ahead,
[Em]                 [Cmaj7/G]  [Em] [Cmaj7/G] [Em] [Cmaj7/G]
 straight on for the days      ahe---ad . . . 


You act as drowning, letting go the fingers one by one.
Come on, there's life beyond the tomb that we have built ourselves;


Chorus:
No more with the long goodbye, I can't stand another tear;
I won't wait for the bell to toll - straight on for the days ahead,
straight on for the days ahead . . .


[Am]
We don't even dare to look each other in the eyes,
   [Cmaj7/G]             [Dsus2/F#]
or say whatever's on our minds . . .
[Cmaj7/G]                        [Dsus2/F#]
 These crushing moments show the kind of people we've become,
[Dsus2/F#]                       [Cmaj7/G] 
seal betrayal with a kiss - and let it all be over, finished, done . . . 

[Em][Cmaj7/G] 4x

It feels so good to kill the thing that stood between the truth and I
Make it fast and make it clean and let the blood run down

Chorus:
No more with the long goodbye, I can't stand another tear;
I won't wait for the bell to toll - straight on for the days ahead,
[Em]                 [Cmaj7/G]  [Em] [Cmaj7/G]
 straight on for the days      ahe---ad . . . 
[Em]                 [Cmaj7/G]       [Dsus2/F#]   [Cmaj7/G]
 straight on for the days ahe-----------------------------ad,

[Em][Cmaj7/G] 3x
