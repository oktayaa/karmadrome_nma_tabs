Intro: [Main Riff]

  [E?]
I woke still half-dreaming I was falling out of the trees
    [D5]                   [Main Riff]       
and tumbling down into the sky
     [E?]
It's cold, so cold sometime before dawn
[Dsus2]                                         [Main Riff]
searching for a light and reaching round for my clothes
        [E?]
That we believe, so must call, rise
The convoys roll into the coming daylight
Let it not be said that everything must die
        [Dsus2]                     [Main Riff]
without some mark being made of its passing 

Chorus:
-------
      [Am]                     [C/G]
As if all the world should now hold its breath
[G]                     [Em]
These are the days that we'll recall
         [D]
when the masks are off the faces 
            [G]
and there's something to fight for
[Em]                [G]
All the lines drawn down in the Soul
        [D]                 [E?]  [Asus2]  [Cmaj7/G] [Asus2add?]
You can let your anger burn crazy 
 
[Main Riff]

There's talking-drums echoed down towards the Kennet Canal
and wood-smoke sweet on the air
And the Yellow Jackets stand with the Thick Blue Line
backs to the woods in the fresh thin carpet of snow
Snelsmore Wood, The Chase, Enbourne Road
Reddings Copse, Tothill down through Andover Grove
Let it not be said that everything must die
without some mark being made of its passing 

Chorus:
-------
      [Am]                     [C/G]
As if all the world should now hold its breath
[G]                     [Em]
These are the days that we'll recall
         [D]
when the masks are off the faces 
            [G]
and there's something to fight for
[Em]                [G]
All the lines drawn down in the Soul
        [D]                 [Am]  [Cmaj7/G] 
You can let your anger burn crazy 

[E?] [Asus2add?] [Cmaj7/G] [Asus2add?]
[Cmaj7/G] [Asus2add?] Lalala, lalala (repeat several times)
[Am] [C/G] [E?]
