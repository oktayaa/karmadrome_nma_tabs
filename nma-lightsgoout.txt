[Riff A]
I went to my mother, said - please make me king
I went to my mother, said - I've got to be king
[Riff B]
She said son - well you've got to wait your turn
Patience is a virtue that you never seemed to learn
You were born with nothing, to nothing you'll return 

[Riff A]
Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning
Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason
Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you now

[Riff A]
I went to my father, said - please make me king
Went to my father, said - I've got to be king
[Riff B]
He said son - you've got to do your time
I've done fifty-three years and I haven't yet done mine
You're just one of the millions waiting in line

[Riff A]
Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning
Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason
Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you now


[F#m]
History gave us meaning, gave us a place
[C#m]
Gave my father reasons for the lines on his face
       [Em*]   
But we asked for the money and money they gave
    [F#m]   
And God, how that made us easy to enslave
   [F#m] 
So today at the office, we picked up the cheque
    [C#m]
The handshake of gold, the stab in the back
    [Em*]
The old men went home silent and bowed
    [F#m]
The young men went drinking, drowning it out
            [F#m]   [G]
So in every street, 
       [B5]    [B5**]
in every town,
        [F#m]              [G]        
comes some young pretender
     [B5]                   [B5**]
Just gunning, gunning for a crown - take it- 

[F#*][E*] 4x
take it

[Riff A]
Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning
Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason
Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you
Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning
Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason
Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you now
