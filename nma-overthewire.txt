[Verse]

[Verse]
Behind all the rusting cranes, in the lengthening shadows of the Empire days
there's a world that waits, but it's not needed.
In the teeming rows behind the goal - yelling for blood on the pitch below;
where does all the passion go when it's not needed?

[Verse]
Over the wire, and into the darkness... 
Over the wire, and into the darkness... 
Over the wire, and into the darkness...

[Verse]
Come evangelists of the Grand New Age proclaiming the future that they stole,
condemning the things they can't control - just like the priests before;
and now I can hear them call - the ghosts of the 1914-18 war 
Where do all the innocents go when they're not needed?

[Verse]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 
[Verse]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 
[Bb]              [Gm]           [Am]  [Bb]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 

                     [Em]                       [Dsus2]
And the dawn it will come like blood across the sky,
                     [Em]                        [Dsus2]
Not the way that you think, not the way that you dream
                  [Em]                    [Dsus2] 
In the silence of God, in the fullness of time,
                      [Gm]                   [C/G]                   [Verse]
like blood across the sky - the dawn it will come - the dawn it will come.

[Verse]
All still, like the pitshafts and the two-mile-down where they buried their hearts;
where does all the loyalty go when it's not needed?
In the plastic seats behind the goal yelling for blood on the pitch below;
where does all the passion go when it's not needed? 
[Verse]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 
[Verse]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 
[Bb]              [Gm]           [Am]  [Bb]
Over the wire and into the darkness... 

                     [Em]                       [Dsus2]
And the dawn it will come like blood across the sky,
                     [Em]                        [Dsus2]
Not the way that you think, not the way that you dream
                  [Em]                    [Dsus2] 
In the silence of God, in the fullness of time,
                      [Gm]                   [C/G]   
like blood across the sky - the dawn it will come 
                     [Em]                       [Dsus2]
And the dawn it will come like blood across the sky,
                     [Em]                        [Dsus2]
Not the way that you think, not the way that you dream
                  [Em]                    [Dsus2] 
In the silence of God, in the fullness of time,
                      [Gm]                   [C/G]                   [Em]
like blood across the sky - the dawn it will come - the dawn it will come
