(1st verse is mainly powerchords)


               [D]           [C]             [G]
I dream of the ocean and the beautiful skies rolling out to sea
               [D]           [C]             [G]
I dream of the ocean and the rip of the tide west of Finnistair
[D]                     [C]           [G]
The weight of the water pouring down, holding on to me
[D/Bb]                [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising
[D/Bb]                [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising


               [D]                 [C]       [G]
I dream of the ocean - through the night the ghosts are sailing still
                [D]                 [C]                 [G]
The James Caird steering east by north-east through the wild Atlantic swell
            [D]                [C]                [G] 
The men lie soaked and cold beneath the sail on a bed of ballast stone
              [D/F]
They hear the boss cry out - I can see them now, 
    [G]
the snow-capped peaks of land
               [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
But it was the ocean, rising, rising
                     [D]   [C] 
A forty foot wall of water crashing down
     [G]
They held their breath and prayed to god
       [D]          [C]   [G]
in the hour of death - To save them
         [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
From the ocean, rising, rising
               [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising

[D], [C], [G]   2x

           [Am]           [C]
And so the years flow and journey's end
    [G]
The old crew sailed south again
         [D]                    [C]
And they buried the boss by the melting snow
       [G]
In the summer winds on the island
            [D/F]
And now the ice it cracks and falls away,
[G]
driven in the storms
         [D]     [C]          [G]
And I'll be there - where the sky touches the sea
                   [D]             [C]             [G]
At the edge of the ocean where the beautiful world fades into the grey
               [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising
               [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising
               [D/Bb] [D/F]   [G]
I dream of the ocean, rising, rising
