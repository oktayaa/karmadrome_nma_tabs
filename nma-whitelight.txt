Intro:
Em, Em7, C/G, Am (4x)

     [Em]            [Em7]
It's another heroes' sunset
    [C/G]                     [Am]
I'm riding on the Great North Road
Coiled and tensed in wonder
As the land turns burning gold
 
               [Em][Em7]          [C/G] [Am]
Ch: Out in the sun,     out in the wind
           [Em]     [Em7]            [C/G] [Am]
I'm nearly ready now    to come back again 

[Em], [Em-maj7] (4x)
[Em], [Em7], [C/G], [Am] (2x)

We are silent in this worship
Beneath the breathing of the summer trees
They sparkle in a dance of silver
As the light falls through the leaves 

Ch: Out in the sun, out in the wind
I'm nearly ready now to come back again 

[Em], [Em-maj7] (4x)

            [F#]                   [A]
So from the wisdom of trances, the armies of Jesus
       [C]                     [Bb]         [G](really?)
To the Voodoo possessions, the different disguises
   [F#]                       [A]
At dusk in the mountains, all bowed in surrender
  [C]             [Bb]          [Eb5] 
A thousand voices calling out a million  
[Em]  [Em7] [C/G] [Am]
names

[Em], [Em7], [C/G], [Am]

[Em] (long)

We knelt as we lit the candles
Around the little shrine
Take me back to the white light
I want to go there again
Ch: Out in the sun, out in the wind
I'm nearly ready now to come back again

[Em], [Em-maj7] (4x)

[Em]                            [Em-maj7]
Take me back to the white light            (4x)

End on [Em]
