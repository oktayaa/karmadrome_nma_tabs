Intro: [G], [Em] (2x)

       [G]
It's a long and warm September
                      [Em]
and we're both still alive
        [G]
And the sea is like a painting
                 [Em]
beneath the neon sky


Chorus:
          [Am]            [G][G/F#][Em]
Raise the dead, raise the dead
         [Am]
We'll go riding on the ghost train,
                   [Em]
together raise the dead


[G], [Em]


Through the summer scented shadows,
we were frozen in the light
And She brushed upon our faces,
disappeared into the night

chorus:

[Interlude] (long [Em])

It's a long and warm September
and we're both still alive
And the sea is like a painting
beneath the neon sky

chorus: (2x)

End:
[G], [Em] (2x)
[Am], [Am], [G][G/F#][Em] (2x)
