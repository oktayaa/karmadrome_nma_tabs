[G] [Em] 6x


[G]                       [Em]         [Bb]              [Em]
I was working shift on the six o’clock, quiet in the pale dawn.
[G]                          [Em]            [Bb]                [Em]
Found a bird caught in the machinery   set it free and watched it go . . .
[G]              [Em]          [Bb]          [CMaj7/G]
Quit the job that very day, and flew into the sky
     [Dsus2]             [Em]    [Dsus2]
just following after this aimless desire,
   [C]       [A]         [Em]    [Dsus2] [CMaj7/G][A]
the worthless desire, the aimless desire, awful    desire...

[Em]

Now I’ve found causes and I’ve found families,
but nothing ever lasts;
I’ve known people I’d die for - if only they had asked.
Where I’m from is not my home, and neither’s where I’m bound;
Just following after this aimless desire - worthless desire . . .

[Em]
[G] [Em] 3x
[Bb]

Our fates (??) they promised everything
And everything's alive
Still got this hole inside of me
Never understood why
Tonight, beneath the bridge where the fires burn,
God . . . take the freedom back, deliver me
from the aimless desire, the worthless desire . . .

   [Em]        [Dsus2]           [CMaj7/G]      [A]
And chimera she waits, and I have still got this hole in me;
still got this hole inside of me . . .

Outro: Em, A, CMaj7/G, A     ;keep repeating
