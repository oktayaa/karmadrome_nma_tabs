Intro:
------
[Em] 4x
[Em][Bm][Em][Em] 2x


[Em]                                [Bm]                       [Em]
Cassandra's still shouting from the city walls but no one ever hears
    [Em]                             [Bm]
And far below the traffic moves like fish upon the ocean floor
       [Em]
to the rhythms of the tide

[G][F#m]                  [Em]
        you don't have to give

[G][F#m]                     [Em]
        no you don't have to give

[Em]

      [Em]                           [Bm]                          [Em]            
We're holding on so tight because it seems as if we're moving very fast
             [Em]                         [Bm]                  [Em]
But all this speed is just illusion as we while away our lives

[G]                           [F#m]                  [Em]
Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give
[G]                           [F#m]                  [Em]
Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give
[G]                          [F#m]                        [Em]
Whatever they ask from you - Whatever they put you through

[G][F#m]
[Asus2][Asus2][C/G][C/G]
[mute] 4x

[mute]                                      [Em]
Fury to the left of me, madmen to the right
       [Em]                         [Bm]
And on Caesars Mall seduction is so sweet
                    [Em]
It's easy to forget there's a price on everything 

Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give
Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give
Whatever they want from you - Whatever they put you through

[G][F#m][Em][Em]
[Em]
