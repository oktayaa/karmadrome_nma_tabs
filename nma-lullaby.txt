   So where do we begin? 
[Am]          [Dm]        [G]
   It must be thirty-five years
           [Am]                     [Dm]      [G]
You've the breath of my mother, the life of a stranger;

[Am]                       [Dm] [G]
    and there's so much to tell 
[Am]                  [Dm]  [G]
    so much I need to know.
[Am]               [Dm]    [G]
All of the stories,    and reasons

[Chorus] 
         [Am]   [Dm] [G]
But your face I remember
         [Am]     [Dm] [G]
and your breath I remember
[Am]                [Dm]  [G]          [Am]
    Take me in your arms, back in your arms 
                [Dm]  [G]
Take me in your arms

[Am][Am][Am][A?] 2x

So walk out tonight and look up at the stars,
the light that you see is as old as I am.
And that's what I see, when I gaze in your eyes
Loving a ghost lost in confusion of time - but our love remains
through these brightest hours.
And my secret world 

[Chorus:]
And your face I remember
and your breath I remember 
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
back in your arms
And your face I remember
and your breath I remember 
Take me in your arms, back in your arms
take me in your arms

[Am][Am][Dm][G] 2x
[Asus4]
