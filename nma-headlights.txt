[D5] a couple of times

[D5]                              [F]          [G]          [D5]
Lit up like a Christmas tree, the oil refinery glows in the night;
    [D5]                      [F]          [G]                [D5]
and down by the shoreline the seagulls fly white, against the black.
    [D5]                        [F]         [G]                [D5]
The great moon riding shotgun - rolling out across the veil of clouds,
    [D5]                            [F]              [G]           [D5]
and you were small, and lying awake listening to the noises in the house.

         [Bb]             [A/C#]    [C]               [G*]
With the best of them you ran, like all of us, in our season
        [Bb]    [A/C#]      [C]             [G*]
Casting memory aside - your history, all forgotten;
       [Bb]                [A/C#]   [C]               [G*]
driven onwards through the years in love with each distraction.
    [Bb]                             [E]
But all the while, the past is close behind;
     [G]                    [D/F]                   [D5]
like headlights on your tail,    headlights on your tail.

     [D5]                                [F]         [G]              [D5]
Your pulse is beating faster now, like a bird flying hard against the wind;
[D5]                         [F]       [G]               [D5]
trying to understand all the crazed compulsions that you feel.
    [D5]                            [F]           [G]         [D5]
And all the little jealousies and betrayals, they echo in the dark;
    [D5]                               [F]          [G]            [D5]
and somewhere back through it all, the key is still turning in the lock.

        [Bb]                 [A/C#]     [C]             [G*]
Now the ghosts that you have laid, they all come out to greet you;
    [Bb]                  [A/C#]   [C]               [G*]
the knowledge that you've gained - well, none of this protects you.
       [Bb]         [A/C#]   [C]              [G*]
You've been so very far, but peace will not embrace you,
    [Bb]                            [E]
for all the while the past is close behind. 
     [G]                    [D/F]                   [D5]
Like headlights on your tail, headlights on your tail.

[D5]

     [G]                    [D/F]                   [D5]
Like headlights on your tail, headlights on your tail.

[D5][D5][G][D/F]
[D5]
