--------------------------

Intro: [B5] with a hammered-on/pulled-off A-String (frets 0/2)

[G/B?]                  [B5]
How did they do this to you?
[G/B?]                  [B5]
How did they do this to you?
             [Em]
Were you the weapon that they used
        [Dsus2/F#]     [C/G]
As they tore apart the family
         [B5]                                [G]
Did they bring you here as they were passing through?
[E]                     [B5]
How did they do this to you? 


[G/B?]                       [B5]
And now you don't want to go home
[G/B?]                                 [B5]
And now you say that you never will go home
       [Em]
Take a tram across the city
         [Dsus2/F#]        [C/G]
Past the places where your brother died
       [B5]                           [G]
Of the comfort for the girls who work alone
[E]                                  [B5]
And I can't tell you that you're not alone 


       [C#m]                        [G]
In the cities of the far north, the skies are cold and clear
    [F#?]                 [E?]
The loneliness is aching
    [C#m]                   [G]
And after all this time and after all these words
     [F#?]                   [F#]
Your hands are still shaking 

[G]                     [B5]
Why did they do this to you?
[G]                     [B5]
Why did they do this to you?
Were they cut off from their past?
Did they try to kill the future?
Do we all forget the things that we once knew?
Why did they do this to you? 

[Bridge]
In these far northern cities, the skies are cold and clear
The loneliness is aching
And after all this time and after all these words
Your hands are still shaking 

[G]                         [B5]
Who was it that did this to you?
[G/B?]                      [B5]
Who was it that did this to you?
Well if I could have my way
I would line them up against a wall
Do unto them as they have done to you

[E]                 [G]
Who was it that did this?
[E]                         [B5]
Who was it that did this to you?
