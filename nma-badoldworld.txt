Dear Justin, I know it's been a long time
                             C/G                     Em             D
Remember all those nights we spent sitting up talking in your front room
                   C/G                Em                 D                    C/G
About leaving this worn out world and starting again far away in a better place
            Em             C/G                  D
Well that's where I am now - but still thinking about you 

Chorus:
                Em         C/G    D
I'm never going back there
                                    Em     C/G   D
I'm never going back to the bad old world


I was travelling with Laurel way up on the north coast
She's got family living up here in a nearby town
We found a piece of land that looks out towards 
the north sea islands across the bay
And the sun is shining on the water today as I look out of our front door 

Ch: I'm never going back there
I'm never going back to the bad old world

Interlude: Em, C/G, Em, C/G, D, D, D, D

Are you still scared of the future? Well, that doesn't surprise me
You could come up and stay here a while, back off from the killing wheel
I used to think it was me who'd somehow sold out 
or given in on some almighty cause,
But what difference would it make? It feels good to be out here. 

Ch: I'm never going back there
I'm never going back to the bad old world

End: Em, C/G, D, D 2x
