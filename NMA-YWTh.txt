Intro:
[C][G?][Am][Em?]


        [C]                      [G?]   
Well you say, you say it’s such a small small world
      [Am]                     [Em?]
flying Club Class back from the far-east
         [C]                  [G?]
curled up safe and warm in the big chair
        [Am]                        [Em?] 
you were flying through the skies of anywhere
       [C]                 [G?]
Get the courtesy car to the Sheraton
       [Am]               [Em?]             [C]                   
there’s live on-the-spot reports from the CNN between the ad-breaks
[G?]                [Am]             [Em?]
so you think you know what’s going on - but you don’t
           [C]                        [G?]
because you weren’t in Belfast, no you weren’t there
          [Am]                    [Em?]
and no you weren’t in Waco, no you weren’t there
       [C]                    [G?]
and you weren’t in Kosovo, you weren’t there
       [F?]                      [G?]
and you weren’t in my head so you don’t know how it felt
[Am]          [Em?]                  [C]
walking arm in arm with crowds to the square
       [G?]                   [F?][G?][Am]     [Em?]
and the banners waving and the sun     glinting 

[C][G?][Am][Em?]

        [C]               [G?]
All this information swims round and round 
      [Am]               [Em?]
like a shoal of fish in a tank going nowhere
[C]                    [G?]
Up and down between the glass walls
         [Am]                            [Em?]
You’re so safe in the knowledge they’re impenetrable
       [C]                           [G?]
and you look out at the world and see nothing at all
     [Am]                        [Em?]          [C]
so go back to sleep and you’ll be woken when the time comes
          [G?]                 [F?]                [G?]
and you’ll never know just what hit you or where it came from
           [Am]                        [G?]
because you weren’t in Bradford, no you weren’t there
       [F?]                        [G?]
and you weren’t on the hill, no you weren’t there
       [Am]                   [G?]
and you weren’t with us so you never saw
         [F?]                         [G?]                       [Am]       
just what happened when the television crews came knocking on the door
              [Em?]
how the people told them all to go to Hell, 
[C]                    [G?]
smashed the cameras and sent them away
          [F?]                 [G?]
There were sirens going off and policemen coming in
   [Am]                        [Em?]
and all that you love was being swept away
      [C]                  [G?]             [F?]
in the rush of a black tide all done in your name
          [G?]                 [Am]           [G?]
and you’ll never know just what happened there
         [F?]  [G?]          [Am]    [Em?]   
or how it feels - just how it feels . . .
