        Am                           G
It took fourteen hours to hitch from London to Portsmouth
      Em
I can picture you in your battered old coat
Am                         G
Blown by the trucks on the side of the road
Em                       Dsus2/F#
Cursing the world just until one pulls over
    Am               G
The cab is warm, the driver is talking
    Em
And oh if he had his time over again
        Am                          G
And you laugh with the man, but you think of another
Em                        Dsus2/F#
Stealing away around each darkened corner
    Am                    G             Am  
The ghost of your father always, always watching
       C/G                    Am
And he waits for you when the black tide comes

        Bb                     Dm
And you feel the ghost of your father
        Bb                     Dm
And you feel the ghost of your father
        Bb                     C/G    Dsus2/F#
And you feel the ghost of your father waiting 


An unbearable stillness hangs over these days
Humming with the promises broken
The bewildered watch from behind misted-up glass
As the ambitious and lucky get to feed on the carcass
When you feel so much in such a small space
Do you think you can keep on running
Like the papers that blow down your empty street
Outside in the dark when you cannot sleep
The ghost of your father always, always watching 
And he waits for you when the black tide comes

Do you feel the ghost of your father waiting?

Am, G, Em, Dsus2/F# (4x)

Do you feel the ghost of your father waiting?
