[Em]          [F?]           
Stepping out onto the stage
   [G?]             [F?]
The smalltown star tonight
[Em]          [F?]
Flexes out for fame and fortune
[G?]     [F?]
Into the lights

The way she tears into the heart
Makes me realise
That I never understood hatred
Until I looked into those eyes - she cries

[Em]             [D]          [Bm]
No one's going to talk down to me again
[Em]                  [D]       [Bm]
No one's ever going to patronise me again

            [C]              [Bb]
I'm going to get out of this town
[C]            [Bb]
Steal myself a crown
            [C]              [Bb]
I'm going to get myself some power
            [F]
If it's the last thing that I do


Heading out of Bradford
With a ticket on the train
And a faith as hard as steel
Sharp as any pain
Gets pictures in the papers
Smiling oh so good
While she lies in bed with racing dreams
Hot as blood

Cos love will make you happy
And love will keep you warm
And love will build a cushion
To keep you safe from harm

But hate will drive you onwards
Hate will drive you upwards
Till you can get back all the bastards
Who ever tried to put you down 

And when she's gone forever
Please don't lay her down to rest
In a quiet little churchyard
Along with all the rest
Throw a great big party
To remember that she lived
Give her headlines on the TV
To remember who she is

Cos no one's ever going to talk 
Down to her again
No one's ever going to patronise her again

She's going to get out of this town
Steal herself a crown
She's going to get herself some power
If it's the last thing that she does
If it's the one thing that she does
If it's the only thing that she ever does
